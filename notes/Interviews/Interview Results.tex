First Image:
+overall, agree with AI (L)
-have to see original image (G, H)
-some cells are not detected, especially negative ones (I, Ra, Ri)
-diff Patholgogists choose different thresholds and get different results (Ra)#
-but still, should adjust threshold until we get optimal result (Ri, H) 
-trust if it would immediately get it right (Ri)

Counterfactuals (1Ax):
+threshold shows why its missing cells, like it (Ri, I, H)
+helps me to know when to trust it (Ri)
+agree/like with extremes (Ra, I)
-want to adjust threshold (Ri, H)
-multiple tissue array to evaluate different features (H)

Counterfactuals (2Ax):
+helps understand positive labels and pitfalls (Ri)
+good since too many unclassified cells could falsify result (I)
-prefer 1Ax since dont have to think about unclassified results, provide shortcut for image comparison (I)
-is addon, not necessary info (G, Ra)

CA:
+helps me trust, understand (Ra, H)
-miss descriptive factors - staining intensity, thresholds for nucleus size, what is regularity (Ri, Ra, L, H, G)
-miss combination effect of features (Ra, G)
-too much info, have to read (L)
-not useful for this task since I know factors (Ri, I)
-useful for different tissue types and tasks (Ri)

Saliency Maps:
+see if salient objects are not the right ones (for other task) (G, I, Ra, Ri)
-what features are applied? Dont understand algo (G, H, I, L, Ra, Ri)
Meta: gives false confidence (Ri)

Trust Scores:
+good info (Ri, Ra, L, I, H, G)
+helps me see limits (Ri), good for final control (H)
-would like interactivity to adjust threshold (Ri, Ra, I, G)
-show me what ground truth data was (Ri)

Prototypes:
+simplest (G, Ra, Ri)
+helps me trust (I, Ra), more important than understand
+proof quality of staining (I, Ra)
-show more prototypes (G, H)
-no info since I know it can do easiest job, but what about hard ones (L, Ri)
-only applicable for binary cases (L)

General:
-trust: would have to see it work (L, I, G) and ground truth data (L, H) - risk of trusting ground truth data!
-Pathologist way of showing: highlight region and make annotation (H, G)
-AI as flag if something is unusual (I)
-Pathologist want easy, visual explanations (Ri, I)
-new approach of ground truth data examples (Ri)
-animosity and reluctance for AI explains some low results, hardly digital pathology and seldom AI (L, H)
-better example prostate cancer for AI task (H), highlight tumor tissue (SM, L), Lymphocytes vs. Plasmocytes (G)
