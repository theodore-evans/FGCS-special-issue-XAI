Dear X,

As you may know, one of the central themes of the empaia project is that of explainability for AI solutions in digital pathology. I am writing to invite you to contribute to this research by taking part in a 60-minute expert interview.

Explainability, and explainable AI (xAI), refers to AI and machine learning solutions that try to make the logic behind their results understandable to their users. In order to understand the expectations and requirements for explainable AI-assistance in pathology, the empaia consortium is performing research directly with our clinical users. One part of this is our online xAI usability survey, a link to which you can find below. The results of this survey, however, mean little without contextualisation by qualitative expert insights. Therefore, we are reaching out to expert users within the empaia network in order to gather their impressions and feedback on some of the proposed classes of xAI methods from the current state of the art.

The results of these interviews, along with those of the survey, will be evaluated for submission of a paper in the [Future Generation Computer Systems Special Issue on Explainable AI for Healthcare](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/future-generation-computer-systems/call-for-papers/explainable-artificial-intelligence-for-healthcare). This will the the first of a number of publications by the empaia consortium to the theme of xAI in digital pathology.

To participate, please choose a time slot by following one of the links below:

Your contribution will help to define user requirements for the next generation of computational pathology applications. 

Thank you for your time and engagement.

All the best,
Y
