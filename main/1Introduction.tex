% INTRODUCE PAPER
Short preamble about 'black-box' methods in Medicine, focus on DL \cite{piccialli_survey_2021}

Current regulatory landscape regarding explainability in AI-assisted digital pathology

Another short preamble about explainability methods for medicine \cite{poceviciute_survey_2020} + more recent survey papers? What classes of XAI are available, in use > summary of the type of information these provide about models in AI solutions

Address shortcoming identified  on the limitations of working on the topic of explainability from a purely algorithmic perspective. Need for embedded, transdisciplinary XAI research \cite{tjoa_survey_2020} (and others)

Introduction of this paper as a case study in context of a (set of) specific application(s), and the interpretations, expectations and needs of specific stakeholders of this application.

What identified requirements can already be met by the current technical state of the art, what are the barriers that need to be overcome to connect user requirements with technical capabilities? What open research questions does this identify
